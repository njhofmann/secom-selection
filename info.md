General information about this code

1.) **transform.py** - load raw data and convert it into numpy arrays

2.) **preprocess.py** - preprocess transformed data

3.) **process.py** - execute model evaluation for SVC, logistical regression, or naive Bayes model

4.) Results for each model evaluation are under respective txt files:

    - log_reg.txt - logistical regression results
    
    - nb.txt - naive Bayes results
    
    - svc.txt - support vector classifier results

- -1 = pass, 1 = failure --> 0 = pass, 1 = failure
